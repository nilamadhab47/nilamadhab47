## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a **Backend & Cloud Engineer (SDE-II)** with **3.5+ years of experience** designing and scaling **AWS-based distributed systems**.

I’ve owned **end-to-end system design**, **zero-downtime migrations**, and backend platforms serving **200K+ users**, **20K–30K DAU**, and **large real-time device fleets (20K+ devices)**. I work primarily on **backend architecture, scalability, reliability**, and **production systems**.

Currently, I’m working as a **Lead Engineer → Head of Engineering (hands-on IC)**, where I design backend platforms, AWS infrastructure, and CI/CD pipelines while remaining deeply involved in system design and implementation.
